# Web Resume

## Overview
This project is a **web-based resume** designed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides a visually appealing and interactive representation of my profile as an aspiring AI/ML engineer.

The resume includes sections such as:
- Personal information
- About Me
- Motivational Quotes
- Professional Links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Profile Image

The resume is still a **work-in-progress**, and I am continuously enhancing its design and features to make it more engaging.
